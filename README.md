# Awesome OSC
Welcome to the Open Source Community, we understand that navigating through projects and finding resources would take a fair share of your time.

So, we've created this repository so that you could navigate to the resources, repositories, and projects that you would wish to look into.

## Why Awesome? [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
Awesome lists are a category that's come into play since [Sindre](https://github.com/sindresorhus) started off his repository called [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), which evolved into one of the largest lists on GitHub containing links to other lists, each list going deeper into a specific category.
